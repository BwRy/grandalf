Installation
============

Grandalf suggests the following python packages:

- http://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy, for the directed-constrained layout
- http://www.dabeaz.com/ply, for importing graphs from graphviz_ *dot* files.


Installation is straightforward for most packages using pip_/pip3.
Note that for python2, the future_ package is now required to support new
python3 *bytes* when needed.
